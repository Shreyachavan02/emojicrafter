## 💡 Why I Built This Project
Emojis are a universal language, but sometimes you want something unique! I built Emojicrafter to let anyone create, customize, and collect their own emojis in a fun, distraction-free environment. This project solves the problem of limited emoji options by letting you design your own, making it easy for anyone to express themselves in a new way. 😃

## 📝 Description
Emojicrafter is built using a modern React stack. All emoji creations are saved in your browser, and the app is fully responsive and easy to customize.

### Features:
- ✍️ Add or edit emoji/color options in `Home.jsx`.
- 🎨 Modern, clean UI with CSS modules.
- 📱 Mobile-first, but looks great on desktop too.
- 🌍 Anyone can create and save emojis for free.

## 🚀 Future Scope
In the future, I want to add more emoji styles, allow users to download or share their creations, and maybe even add a login system so people can save their favorites across devices. I hope to make Emojicrafter a go-to platform for creative expression for everyone.
